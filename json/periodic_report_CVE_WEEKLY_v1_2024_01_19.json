Microsoft has released security updates for Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) versions 120.0.2210.133, 120.0.2210.160, and 120.0.6099.216/217 to address this vulnerability. System administrators are advised to apply these updates to mitigate the risk of exploitation. The vulnerability is not directly exploitable and would require an attacker to combine it with other vulnerabilities to perform an attack.

The vulnerability allows spoofing attacks and is related to the use of BR/EDR Secure Connections. Microsoft released a software update enforcing the use of specific encryption and authentication algorithms for Bluetooth pairings that have used BR/EDR Secure Connections. This update aims to mitigate the vulnerability by ensuring the use of secure connections for subsequent Bluetooth pairings. It is crucial to note that the new BR/EDR Secure Connections algorithms will only be utilized if both the local system and the remote paired device support BR/EDR Secure Connections. Additionally, increasing the minimum encryption key size, as per Windows guidance, is advised to enhance security. The exploitability assessment indicates that the vulnerability is less likely to be exploited. System administrators are urged to apply the security updates for the affected Windows versions to safeguard against potential spoofing attacks.
