            "summary": "Microsoft Message Queuing is affected by a remote code execution vulnerability identified as CVE-2023-36582, with a CVSS score of 7.3. The vulnerability allows an authenticated domain user to remotely execute code on the target server, potentially leading to a complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The attack vector is local, requiring user interaction, and the attacker needs to convince a user to connect to a malicious server or compromise a legitimate MSMQ server host. Microsoft has provided a solution by releasing security updates for various Windows versions, including Windows Server 2012, 2016, 2019, and 2022, as well as Windows 10 and 11. System administrators are advised to apply the relevant security updates to mitigate the risk of exploitation. Additionally, enabling the Windows message queuing service can make a system exploitable by this vulnerability, and this feature can be added via the Control Panel. It's crucial for administrators to prioritize the installation of these updates to ensure the security of their systems and prevent potential remote code execution attacks.",

            "summary": "Windows Mark of the Web Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-36584, affects various Windows versions, including Windows Server and Windows 10/11. The vulnerability allows an attacker to craft a malicious file that evades Mark of the Web (MOTW) defenses, leading to a limited loss of integrity and availability of security features such as Protected View in Microsoft Office. To exploit this, the attacker could host a file on a controlled server and convince a user to download and open it, interfering with the MOTW functionality. The vulnerability is rated as Important with a CVSS score of 5.4/5.0. Microsoft has provided a solution by releasing security updates for the affected Windows versions, addressing the Security Feature Bypass. System administrators are advised to apply the official patches or security updates to mitigate the risk of exploitation. The attack vector involves user interaction, and the exploit code maturity is functional. The remediation level is an official fix, and the report confidence is confirmed.

The vulnerability allows an authenticated domain user to remotely execute code on the target server, potentially leading to a complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The attack vector is local, requiring user interaction, and the attacker needs to convince a user to connect to a malicious server or compromise a legitimate MSMQ server host. Microsoft has provided a solution by releasing security updates for various Windows Server versions and Windows 10, addressing the vulnerability and mitigating the risk of exploitation. System administrators are advised to apply the relevant security updates to affected systems to prevent potential remote code execution attacks. Additionally, enabling the Windows message queuing service requires careful consideration, and monitoring for the presence of the 'Message Queuing' service and TCP port 1801 is recommended to detect potential exploitation attempts.",

The vulnerability allows remote code execution and affects all supported versions of Microsoft Windows. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by invoking the PrintHTML API from a locally running application or by tricking a user into doing so, allowing the attacker to launch an app via application protocols without prompting the user. Although the attack vector is local, the exploit is referred to as Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE). Microsoft has provided a complete vendor solution, and security updates have been released for all affected platforms, including Windows Server and Windows 10/11 versions. To stay fully protected, Microsoft recommends that customers who install Security Only updates also install the IE Cumulative updates for this vulnerability.

The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely, impacting confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Successful exploitation requires high attack complexity and user interaction. Microsoft has provided a security update for various Windows versions, including Windows 10, 11, and Server editions, with build numbers 10.0.14393.6351, 10.0.19045.3570, 10.0.22621.2428, and others. System administrators are advised to apply the security updates to mitigate the risk of remote code execution. No explicit workaround or mitigation is provided, emphasizing the importance of applying the official fix. The attack vector being local refers to the location of the attacker, while the exploit itself is carried out locally. Microsoft acknowledges the security community's efforts in coordinated vulnerability disclosure and recommends checking the Microsoft Support Lifecycle for software support lifecycle information.",

The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to send a specially crafted protocol message to a Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) server, leading to remote code execution on the target machine. The attack complexity is high, requiring the attacker to win a race condition, and no user interaction or privileges are needed for exploitation. Successful exploitation results in a total loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Microsoft has released security updates addressing this vulnerability for affected Windows Server and Windows client versions. System administrators are strongly advised to apply the provided security updates to mitigate the risk of exploitation.

            "summary": "Microsoft Message Queuing is affected by a critical remote code execution vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-36697. The vulnerability allows an authenticated domain user to remotely execute code on the target server by convincing a user to connect to a malicious server or compromising a legitimate MSMQ server host. The attacker needs to exploit the Windows message queuing service, which must be enabled for a system to be vulnerable. The impact includes high confidentiality, integrity, and availability risks. Microsoft has provided a solution by releasing security updates for various affected Windows Server and Windows client versions. System administrators are advised to apply the relevant security updates to mitigate the risk of exploitation. Additionally, a mitigation involves checking if the Windows message queuing service is running and TCP port 1801 is listening on the machine.

The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely without requiring any user interaction. This vulnerability impacts various Windows Server and Windows client versions, including Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft has provided a security update to address this vulnerability, and system administrators are strongly advised to apply the relevant patches to mitigate the risk of exploitation. The exploitability assessment indicates that the attack vector is local, despite the CVE title indicating remote code execution, clarifying that the attack itself is carried out locally. The availability of an official fix reduces the urgency for interim remediation, and the confirmed existence of the vulnerability suggests a higher level of technical knowledge available to potential attackers.

The attack vector is local, requiring user interaction, and the attacker needs to convince a user to connect to a malicious server or compromise a legitimate MSMQ server host. Microsoft has provided security updates for various Windows Server versions, including Windows Server 2012, 2016, 2019, and 2022, as well as Windows 10 and 11, to address this vulnerability.
