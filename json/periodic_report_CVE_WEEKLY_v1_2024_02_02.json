The vulnerability allows an attacker to gain the privileges required to install an extension without user interaction. It is remotely exploitable, requiring no user privileges, and has a high attack complexity. Successful exploitation could lead to a browser sandbox escape, with potential minor impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Microsoft has released a security update for Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) with build number 121.0.2277.83, addressing this vulnerability. System administrators are advised to apply the official fix to mitigate the risk of exploitation. For more information, refer to the Microsoft Security Update Guide.",
