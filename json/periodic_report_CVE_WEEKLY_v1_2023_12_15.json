The vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a total loss of availability on impacted systems without requiring user interaction. The attack vector is adjacent, meaning it is limited to systems connected to the same network segment as the attacker. Microsoft has provided an official fix for this vulnerability through security updates for various Windows Server and Windows client versions, including Windows 10 and Windows 11. System administrators are advised to apply the respective security updates to mitigate the risk of exploitation. The exploit code maturity is unproven, and the remediation level is an official fix, indicating the availability of a complete vendor solution. The attack complexity is low, and the attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability.
