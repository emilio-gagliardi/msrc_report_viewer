            "summary": "Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) is affected by a Critical Remote Code Execution Vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-35641. The vulnerability allows an attacker to send a maliciously crafted DHCP message to a server running the ICS service, leading to remote code execution. The attack vector is adjacent, limiting the attack to systems connected to the same network segment as the attacker. Microsoft has provided a solution by releasing security updates for various affected products, including Windows Server and Windows 10/11 versions. System administrators are advised to apply the respective security updates to mitigate the risk of exploitation. Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that ICS is enabled, and there are no mitigating factors beyond this. The availability, integrity, and confidentiality of impacted components are rated as high, emphasizing the severity of the vulnerability.

The vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a total loss of availability on impacted systems without requiring user interaction. The attack vector is adjacent, meaning it is limited to systems connected to the same network segment as the attacker. Microsoft has provided an official fix for this vulnerability through security updates for various Windows Server and Windows client versions, including Windows 10 and Windows 11. System administrators are advised to apply the respective security updates to mitigate the risk of exploitation. The exploit code maturity is unproven, and the remediation level is an official fix, indicating the availability of a complete vendor solution. The attack complexity is low, and the attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability.

            "summary": "Windows Kernel is affected by a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-35635, with a base score of 5.5 and a temporal score of 4.8. The vulnerability could be exploited if an authenticated user opens a specially crafted file locally or on a network share, causing a crash of the operating system. The attack vector is local, with low attack complexity and no privileges required. User interaction is necessary for successful exploitation. The impact is a total loss of availability, allowing the attacker to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component. Microsoft has provided a security update for Windows 11 Version 23H2 and 22H2 for x64-based and ARM64-based systems, with build numbers 10.0.22631.2861 and 10.0.22621.2861, respectively. System administrators are advised to apply the security update to mitigate the risk of exploitation. For further details, refer to the Microsoft Security Update Guide.",
