            "summary": "Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) is affected by an Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-35618, with a CVSS score of 9.6/8.3. The vulnerability allows an attacker to gain the privileges needed to perform code execution, potentially leading to a browser sandbox escape. The attack vector is through a web-based scenario, where an attacker hosts a website containing a specially crafted file designed to exploit the vulnerability, requiring user interaction to click a link and open the file. The severity is rated as Moderate due to the amount of user interaction required, which downgrades the severity according to Microsoft's guidelines. Microsoft has provided an official fix by releasing a security update for Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) with the build number 120.0.2210.61. System administrators are advised to update their Microsoft Edge installations to this version to mitigate the risk of exploitation. For further details, refer to the Microsoft Security Response Center page for CVE-2023-35618.",
