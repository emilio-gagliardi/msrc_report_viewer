            "summary": "Microsoft Windows is affected by a remote code execution vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-38545, in the curl.exe software. This vulnerability is triggered when the victim manually executes the curl.exe utility while using a SOCKS5 proxy with a rate limit option set to 65540 or lower, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Microsoft is actively working to release version 8.4.0 of curl.exe in a future Windows update for supported versions. In the meantime, system administrators are advised to deploy a code integrity policy to restrict the execution of vulnerable versions of curl.exe. Workarounds include using a WDAC policy to deny execution of the vulnerable executable, which can be deployed via Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions, Microsoft Configuration Manager, scripts, or group policies. It's crucial not to remove or replace curl.exe, as doing so may damage the Windows Update component store. For more information and updates, system administrators can refer to the Microsoft Security Update Guide and register for security notifications. The vulnerability affects various versions of Windows, including Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server 2019 and 2022.",

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing the victim to manually launch the curl utility and direct it to connect to a compromised server. Microsoft is actively working to release version 8.4.0 of curl.exe in a future Windows update for currently supported, on-premise versions of Windows clients and servers. The Security Updates table for this CVE will be updated with the Windows update KB numbers for all supported versions as they are released. In the meantime, system administrators are advised to deploy a code integrity policy that restricts the execution of vulnerable versions of curl.exe. This can be achieved using Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policies, which can be deployed via Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions, Microsoft Configuration Manager, scripts, or group policies. It's important to note that under no circumstances should the curl.exe file be removed or replaced, as doing so may damage the Windows Update component store and prevent the installation of further security updates. The workaround only provides an operating system level guarantee that the vulnerable version of the curl tool cannot be executed. More information about this vulnerability and the workaround can be found in the NVD and curl.se websites.",
