The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to remotely execute code on the target server. The attack vector is through the Windows message queuing service, which needs to be enabled for a system to be exploitable. Microsoft has provided a solution by releasing security updates for various affected Windows Server and Windows client versions. System administrators are advised to apply the respective security updates to mitigate the risk of exploitation. Additionally, a mitigating factor is to check if the 'Message Queuing' service is running and TCP port 1801 is listening on the machine. The impact of the vulnerability is severe, with high confidentiality, integrity, and availability risks. The exploit code maturity is unproven, and the remediation level indicates that an official fix is available.

The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass security features by convincing a user to access a URL in a less restricted Internet Security Zone than intended. Exploitation requires user interaction, such as clicking on a specially crafted URL provided by the attacker. Microsoft has provided a security update to address this vulnerability by correcting security feature behavior to properly map affected URLs to the correct Security Zone. The affected products include all supported versions of Microsoft Windows except Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, and Windows Server 2012. To stay fully protected, Microsoft recommends that customers who install Security Only updates also install the IE Cumulative updates for this vulnerability. The underlying MSHTML, EdgeHTML, and scripting platforms are still supported despite the retirement of Internet Explorer 11 and deprecation of Microsoft Edge Legacy. System administrators are advised to apply the provided security update to mitigate the risk of exploitation and ensure the protection of their systems.",

Customers allowing untrusted code execution may need to implement extra security features. Microsoft has seen performance impact with these mitigations, particularly when hyperthreading is disabled. Azure Virtual Machine offerings using certain AMD EPYC processors are affected, but an update is being deployed across Azure infrastructure to secure most customers automatically. However, a small subset of customers with custom Maintenance Configurations on their Azure Virtual Machines may need to apply the update. Microsoft Azure assets are being protected through the deployment of mitigations. Customers can refer to the AMD advisory to determine affected CPUs.

The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system by convincing a user to take action, such as clicking a link or opening a malicious attachment. Successful exploitation could lead to high loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Microsoft has provided a solution by releasing security updates for various Windows versions, including Windows 10, 11, and Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019. System administrators are advised to install the August 2023 Windows updates as soon as possible to mitigate the risk of exploitation. The attack complexity is high, and no user interaction is required for exploitation. The attacker can plant a malicious file evading Mark of the Web (MOTW) defenses, resulting in code execution on the victim system.",
