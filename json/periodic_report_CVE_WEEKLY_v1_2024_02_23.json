            "summary": "Microsoft Power Platform Connector is impacted by a critical spoofing vulnerability, CVE-2023-36019, with a CVSS score of 9.6. The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate a malicious link, application, or file to disguise it as legitimate, tricking the victim. It requires user interaction, where the user must click on a specially crafted URL to be compromised. Successful exploitation could lead to a scope change, with malicious scripts executing in the victim\u2019s browser. Microsoft has provided a mitigation by requiring custom connectors using OAuth 2.0 to use a per-connector redirect URI, with a deadline of March 29, 2024. After this date, users will no longer be able to create connections to or use existing OAuth 2.0 custom connectors that have not been updated. Affected customers were notified via the Microsoft 365 Admin Center and Service Health in the Azure Portal. System administrators are advised to validate and update their custom connectors to mitigate the risk of exploitation.",

The vulnerability allows an attacker to gain SYSTEM privileges. It was addressed by updates released in November 2023, but inadvertently omitted from the November 2023 Security Updates. Microsoft strongly recommends installing the November 2023 updates to mitigate this vulnerability. Various Windows versions and editions, including Windows Server and Windows 10, are impacted. Security updates with build numbers 5032202, 5032189, 5032190, 5034819, 5032197, 5034830, and others are available to address this issue. The impact of exploitation includes high confidentiality, integrity, and availability risks. The attack vector is local, with low attack complexity and privileges required. No user interaction is needed for exploitation. A complete vendor solution is available, and no exploit code is currently available, making exploitation less likely. System administrators are strongly advised to install the recommended updates to protect affected systems from this elevation of privilege vulnerability.",
