This vulnerability has a critical impact, with a CVSS score of 9.0. It allows impersonation and could be exploited by an authenticated attacker through a machine-in-the-middle (MITM) attack or local network spoofing. The attack vector is adjacent, requiring the attacker to gain access to the restricted network before running an attack. Successful exploitation could lead to a scope change, affecting resources beyond the security scope managed by the vulnerable component. Microsoft has provided security updates for various Windows Server and Windows client versions, addressing this critical vulnerability. System administrators are advised to apply the relevant security updates to mitigate the risk of exploitation.

This vulnerability allows an attacker with physical access to bypass the BitLocker Device Encryption feature on the system storage device, potentially gaining access to encrypted data. The attack vector is physical, with low attack complexity and low privileges required. Microsoft has provided a solution by releasing security updates for various Windows versions, including Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server 2022, to address this vulnerability. Depending on the Windows version, system administrators may need to take additional steps to update Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) to be protected from this vulnerability. For some versions, the process of updating WinRE is fully automated, while for others, an automated solution is available. Microsoft has also developed a sample script to automate updating WinRE from the running Windows OS. It's important to note that a vulnerable version of WinRE WIM file cannot be used to exploit this vulnerability, and if TPM+PIN BitLocker protectors are being used, the attacker needs to know the TPM PIN to exploit the vulnerability. System administrators are advised to apply the provided security updates and follow the recommended steps to ensure protection from this vulnerability.",

The vulnerability affects specific Microsoft Surface hardware computers, including Hub 3, Laptop Studio, Pro 7+, and others. It is caused by Windows incorrectly allowing certain kernel-mode pages to be marked as Read, Write, Execute (RWX) even with HVCI enabled, enabling an attacker to run a specially crafted application at administrator level to bypass code integrity protections. Microsoft has released security updates for various Windows versions, including Windows 10 and 11, to address this vulnerability. The exploit requires an attacker to compromise admin credentials on the device, and successful exploitation could lead to a total loss of integrity or a complete loss of protection. System administrators are advised to apply the available security updates to mitigate the risk of exploitation. For more information, refer to the Microsoft Security Update Guide.",

            "summary": "Microsoft Local Security Authority Subsystem Service is affected by an Information Disclosure Vulnerability, identified as CVE-2024-20692, with a CVSS score of 5.7/5.0. The vulnerability allows an attacker to retrieve sensitive data in plain-text by convincing a user to connect to an Active Directory Domain Controller and stealing network secrets. This could lead to further attacks. The attack requires user interaction and low privileges, meaning an authorized attacker must be on the network to monitor domain network traffic or convince an authenticated user to execute a malicious script. Microsoft has provided security updates for various Windows Server and Windows client versions to address this vulnerability. System administrators are advised to apply the relevant security updates to mitigate the risk of information disclosure. For more information, refer to the Microsoft Security Support Lifecycle.",
