The vulnerability requires user interaction, such as opening a specially crafted file, making it exploitable in email or web-based attack scenarios. Successful exploitation could lead to a browser sandbox escape, with potential minor impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Although the severity is rated as moderate, the CVSS score is higher due to the level of user interaction required. Microsoft has released a security update for Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) with the build number 117.0.2045.31 to address this vulnerability.

This vulnerability was assigned by Chrome and is ingested by Microsoft Edge through Chromium, which addresses the issue. An exploit for CVE-2023-4863 exists in the wild, making it crucial for system administrators to take immediate action. The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the Chromium Open Source Software (OSS) consumed by Microsoft Edge. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code, posing a severe risk to affected systems. Microsoft has provided a security update for Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) with the build number 116.0.1938.81, which system administrators are strongly advised to apply to mitigate the risk of exploitation. For more information, refer to the Google Chrome Releases page. Additionally, affected customers can check if the update is installed using PowerShell command: Get-AppxPackage -Name Microsoft.WebpImageExtension. It's important to note that Microsoft Store will automatically update affected customers, and those in disconnected environments can obtain the update through their organizations using the Microsoft Store for Business and Microsoft Store for Education.",

            "summary": "Windows Miracast Wireless Display is affected by a remote code execution vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-38147, with a CVSS score of 8.8. The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker within proximity to send and receive radio transmissions to execute arbitrary code on the target system. This requires the vulnerable system to be configured to allow 'Projecting to this PC' and marked as 'Available Everywhere', which is not a default setting. Microsoft has provided a security update for various Windows versions, including Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server, with build numbers 10.0.14393.6252, 10.0.10240.20162, 10.0.19045.3448, 10.0.22621.2283, 10.0.19044.3448, 10.0.22000.2416, 10.0.20348.1970, and 10.0.17763.4851. System administrators are advised to apply the security updates to mitigate the risk of exploitation. The attack vector is adjacent, and the vulnerability can be exploited without user interaction. Microsoft acknowledges the efforts of the security community in coordinated vulnerability disclosure.",
