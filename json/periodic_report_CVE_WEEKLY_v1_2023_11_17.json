            "summary": "Microsoft has addressed the CVE-2023-38545 vulnerability, a SOCKS5 heap buffer overflow impacting Windows. The vulnerability is in the curl.exe software consumed by Windows, allowing remote code execution. To exploit it, the victim must manually execute the curl.exe utility, use a SOCKS5 proxy, have a rate limit option set to 65540 or lower, and request an attacker-controlled domain. Microsoft has released Windows security updates on November 14, 2023, including curl 8.4.0 to address this vulnerability. Customers are advised to install these updates to ensure they have the most up-to-date version of curl. Automatic update recipients do not need to take further action. Microsoft warns against removing or replacing curl.exe, recommending the deployment of a code integrity policy to restrict the execution of vulnerable versions. Workarounds involve using a WDAC policy to deny execution of the vulnerable executable. System administrators can deploy this policy using MDM solutions, Microsoft Configuration Manager, scripts, or group policies. The vulnerability affects various Windows versions, including Windows 10 and 11, and Windows Server 2019 and 2022. For further information, customers can refer to the NVD and curl.se websites.",

            "summary": "Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) is affected by a remote code execution vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-36008. The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 6.6 and a temporal score of 5.8, indicating a moderate severity. It is caused by a flaw that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code locally, requiring user interaction. The attacker does not need prior privileges to carry out the attack. Successful exploitation could lead to some loss of availability and limited ability to perform code execution. Microsoft has released security updates for Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) versions 119.0.2151.72 and 118.0.2088.109, addressing this vulnerability. System administrators are advised to apply the latest security updates to mitigate the risk of exploitation. For more information, refer to the Microsoft Security Response Center page.",
