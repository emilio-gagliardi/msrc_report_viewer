            "summary": "Windows MSHTML Platform Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-36805, impacts all supported versions of Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability allows for remote code execution with a base score of 7.0 and a temporal score of 6.1. It is caused by a flaw in the MSHTML platform, which could lead to high privilege access for an attacker. Successful exploitation could result in a major loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Microsoft recommends installing the September 2023 updates to be fully protected. Customers who install the Security Only updates for affected Windows Server versions should also install the IE Cumulative update. Automatic update configurations do not need further action. The vulnerability affects Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and other Windows versions. The underlying MSHTML, EdgeHTML, and scripting platforms are still supported despite the retirement of Internet Explorer 11 and deprecation of Microsoft Edge Legacy. The IE Cumulative updates include changes to address vulnerabilities in the MSHTML platform and scripting engine. System administrators should prioritize the installation of the recommended updates to mitigate the risk of exploitation.",
