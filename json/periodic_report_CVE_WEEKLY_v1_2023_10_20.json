The vulnerability allows an attacker to perform enclave memory read and unprivileged write to enclave memory from a host application, potentially leaking memory contents. Successful exploitation could lead to some loss of integrity, such as file overwrite with minimal impact. The attack vector is network-based, with low attack complexity and no privileges required. User interaction is not necessary for exploitation. Microsoft has released a security update for Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) with the build number 118.0.2088.46, addressing this vulnerability. System administrators are advised to apply the official fix to mitigate the risk of information disclosure. For further details, refer to the Microsoft Security Response Center page.",

            "summary": "The vulnerability identified as CVE-2023-38039 affects the curl.exe software consumed by Microsoft Windows, leading to a denial of service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing the victim to manually launch the curl utility and direct it to connect to a compromised server. Microsoft is actively working to release version 8.4.0 of curl.exe in a future Windows update for currently supported, on-premise versions of Windows clients and servers. The Security Updates table for this CVE will be updated with the Windows update KB numbers for all supported versions as they are released. In the meantime, system administrators are advised to deploy a code integrity policy that restricts the execution of vulnerable versions of curl.exe. This can be achieved using Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policies, which can be deployed via Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions, Microsoft Configuration Manager, scripts, or group policies. It's important to note that under no circumstances should the curl.exe file be removed or replaced, as doing so may damage the Windows Update component store and prevent the installation of further security updates. The workaround only provides an operating system level guarantee that the vulnerable version of the curl tool cannot be executed. More information about this vulnerability and the workaround can be found in the NVD and curl.se websites.",

The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to send a specially crafted protocol message to a Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) server, potentially leading to remote code execution on the server machine. The attack complexity is high, requiring the attacker to win a race condition, and no user interaction or privileges are needed for exploitation. Successful exploitation results in a critical impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Microsoft has provided a solution by releasing security updates for affected Windows Server and client versions, including Server Core installations. System administrators are advised to apply the official patches to mitigate the risk of exploitation. Additionally, the vulnerability is only exploitable on Windows Servers that have installed and configured the RRAS role with L2TP support, which is not installed and configured by default, providing some level of mitigation for systems without this configuration.",
