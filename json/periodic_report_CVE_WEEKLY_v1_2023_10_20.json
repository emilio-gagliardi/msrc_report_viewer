It is a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability with a maximum severity of Important. The vulnerability is related to the HTTP/2 protocol and can be exploited to cause a DoS condition. Microsoft has provided workarounds to mitigate the risk, including disabling the HTTP/2 protocol on web servers using Registry Editor and limiting applications to HTTP1.1 via configuration settings for Kestrel endpoints. It's crucial to install the security updates for the affected products as soon as possible. The impact of exploitation could lead to service unavailability, affecting the availability and reliability of web services and applications. System administrators should carefully follow the provided workarounds, considering the potential risks associated with Registry Editor modifications.

The vulnerability requires user interaction, where the user needs to click on a specially crafted URL to be compromised by the attacker. Successful exploitation could lead to minor loss of confidentiality and integrity, with no availability impact. An attacker would need to combine this with other vulnerabilities to perform an attack. Microsoft has released a security update for Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) with the build number 118.0.2088.46, addressing this vulnerability. System administrators are advised to apply the security update to mitigate the risk of exploitation. For more information, refer to the Microsoft Support Lifecycle page.",

            "summary": "The Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) Remote Code Execution Vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-41765, impacts Windows Server and Windows client operating systems, including Windows 10 and 11. The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to send a specially crafted protocol message to a Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) server, potentially leading to remote code execution on the server machine. The attack complexity is high, requiring the attacker to win a race condition, and no user interaction or privileges are needed for exploitation. Successful exploitation results in a critical impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Microsoft has provided a solution by releasing security updates for affected Windows Server and client versions, including Server Core installations. System administrators are advised to apply the official patches to mitigate the risk of exploitation. Additionally, the vulnerability is only exploitable on Windows Servers that have installed and configured the RRAS role with L2TP support, which is not installed and configured by default, providing some level of mitigation for systems without this configuration.",

This vulnerability is triggered when the victim manually executes the curl.exe utility while using a SOCKS5 proxy with a rate limit option set to 65540 or lower, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Microsoft is actively working to release version 8.4.0 of curl.exe in a future Windows update for supported versions. In the meantime, system administrators are advised to deploy a code integrity policy to restrict the execution of vulnerable versions of curl.exe. Workarounds include using a WDAC policy to deny execution of the vulnerable executable, which can be deployed via Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions, Microsoft Configuration Manager, scripts, or group policies. It's crucial not to remove or replace curl.exe, as doing so may damage the Windows Update component store. For more information and updates, system administrators can refer to the Microsoft Security Update Guide and register for security notifications. The vulnerability affects various versions of Windows, including Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server 2019 and 2022.",

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing the victim to manually launch the curl utility and direct it to connect to a compromised server. Microsoft is actively working to release version 8.4.0 of curl.exe in a future Windows update for currently supported, on-premise versions of Windows clients and servers. The Security Updates table for this CVE will be updated with the Windows update KB numbers for all supported versions as they are released. In the meantime, system administrators are advised to deploy a code integrity policy that restricts the execution of vulnerable versions of curl.exe. This can be achieved using Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policies, which can be deployed via Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions, Microsoft Configuration Manager, scripts, or group policies. It's important to note that under no circumstances should the curl.exe file be removed or replaced, as doing so may damage the Windows Update component store and prevent the installation of further security updates.

            "summary": "Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) is affected by an Information Disclosure Vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-36409, with a CVSS score of 6.5/5.7. The vulnerability allows an attacker to perform enclave memory read and unprivileged write to enclave memory from a host application, potentially leaking memory contents. Successful exploitation could lead to some loss of integrity, such as file overwrite with minimal impact. The attack vector is network-based, with low attack complexity and no privileges required. User interaction is not necessary for exploitation. Microsoft has released a security update for Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) with the build number 118.0.2088.46, addressing this vulnerability. System administrators are advised to apply the official fix to mitigate the risk of information disclosure. For further details, refer to the Microsoft Security Response Center page.",
