            "summary": "Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) is affected by a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in WebRTC, identified as CVE-2023-7024. This vulnerability was assigned by Chrome and is addressed by ingesting Chromium. The latest version of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) with build number 120.0.2210.91 is no longer vulnerable. The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the Chromium Open Source Software (OSS) consumed by Microsoft Edge. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code. Google is aware of the existence of an exploit for CVE-2023-7024 in the wild. Microsoft has provided a solution by releasing a security update for Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) with the build number 120.0.2210.91. System administrators are advised to update their Microsoft Edge installations to the latest version to mitigate the risk of exploitation. For more information, refer to the [Google Chrome Releases](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2023) page.",
